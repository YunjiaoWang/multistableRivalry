mainHierarchNoiseSeq_betaAll.m is the main file for generating the four figures in the paper: 
More specifically, the file will generate the following graphs:
 1. Predominance of grouped percepts vs grouping strength beta
 2. Dominance durations of grouped and single-eye percepts vs beta
 3. The ratios of number of visits to grouped percepts  vs beta
 4. The transition probabilities  vs beta

The remaining files are all supporting codes for mainHierarchNoiseSeq_betaAll.m.
