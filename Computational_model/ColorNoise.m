function noise = ColorNoise(Dt,  N, m, sigma)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Using Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process to produce colored noise:
% The noise n(t) is an OU process with zeros means and 
% deviation sigma. i.e. n(t) is a solution to
%   
% n'(t) = -\frac{n}{taus} + sigma sqrt{\frac{2}{taus}} xi(t)
% 
% where xi(t)is a white noise process with zero mean and variance
% t-t' for time t'<t.
